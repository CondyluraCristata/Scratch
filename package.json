  "description": "The star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata) is a small semiaquatic mole found in moist, low elevation areas in the northern parts of North America. It is the only extant member of the tribe Condylurini and genus Condylura, and it has more than 25,000 minute sensory receptors in touch organs, known as Eimer's organs, with which this hamster-sized mole feels its way around. With the help of its Eimer's organs, it may be perfectly poised to detect seismic wave vibrations.",
